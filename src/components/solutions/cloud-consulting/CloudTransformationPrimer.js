                The Transformation Primer is a two-day engagement led by experienced cloud consultants from Mayhem Shield. The engagement begins with an assessment of the organization's current situation, goals, and objectives. This includes understanding the organization's current IT infrastructure, business processes, and identifying any specific challenges that need to be addressed during the migration.

                Based on this assessment, the consultant will help the organization to identify the most appropriate cloud solution for their needs, whether it's a cloud-native, hybrid, single, or multi-cloud solution. The consultant will then work with the organization to develop a comprehensive cloud migration plan, including timelines, milestones, and teams required to execute the plan successfully. The plan also considers the broader organizational transformation that comes with adopting the cloud, including change management, organizational alignment, and skills development.

                Once the plan is in place, the consultant will work with the organization to provide guidance and support throughout the migration process. This includes assistance with the technical aspects of migration, such as data migration, security, and testing. It also includes guidance on how to manage and overcome common challenges around business strategy, such as change management, organizational alignment, and skills development.
