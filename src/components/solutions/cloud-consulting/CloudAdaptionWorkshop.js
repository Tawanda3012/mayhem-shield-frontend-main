                The phrase "cloud-ready" refers to an organization's ability to successfully adopt and utilize cloud computing services. It encompasses a variety of factors such as having a clear and well-defined cloud strategy, the ability to effectively manage and monitor cloud resources, and having the necessary skills and expertise to utilize cloud services. It also includes overcoming common obstacles such as lack of operational readiness and strategy alignment, as well as understanding how to implement governance frameworks and create practical roadmaps for cloud adoption.
