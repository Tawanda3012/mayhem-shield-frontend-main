                The past few years have emphasized the importance of resilience and adaptability for businesses. The ability to quickly respond and recover from various challenges such as natural disasters, cyberattacks and a global pandemic, is more important than ever. To achieve this level of agility, organizations need a solid technology foundation that can flex to meet unforeseen challenges and support future growth. And that foundation is the cloud. According to IDC, the cloud market is expected to reach $1 trillion by 2024 and the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated cloud adoption. To fully utilize the cloud's distributed, scalable nature, a cloud native approach and DevOps services are essential. A cloud native approach involves redesigning systems and apps to embrace rapid change, building immutable components that can be assembled into dynamically orchestrated solutions and development grounded in containers, microservices and service meshes. This approach can empower your IT team to quickly deploy and scale apps to address evolving requirements, experiment without risking system-wide disruption, and conduct rapid testing of new features.

                DevOps is a methodology that aligns development and operations functions with a focus on automation, continuous improvement and cross-functional teams. The DevOps approach promotes collaboration across the business, breaking down organizational silos and helps to optimize automation and scalability using cloud native tools and technologies. It includes a set of processes that enable feedback loops between development and operations teams, allowing for ongoing updates to be deployed to applications in production. For example, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) embed automation into the application development process, providing a fast and efficient way of creating and optimizing business capabilities.
