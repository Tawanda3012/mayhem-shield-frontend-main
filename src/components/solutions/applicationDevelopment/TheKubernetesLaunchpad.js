                As organizations look to extract more value from technology, the need to modernize and re-platform existing applications or develop new cloud-native apps becomes increasingly apparent. However, the process of modernizing applications can be long, tedious, and costly, making it challenging for businesses to experiment with new cloud-native services and demonstrate proof-of-value.
                <br />
                <br />
                Mayhem Shield's Kubernetes Launchpad is designed to help organizations overcome these challenges by providing a high-impact software and services package that rapidly deploys a ready-to-manage <a href="/devops" className="text-blue-500">devOps</a> platform and modernizes an application. This allows businesses to explore, experiment with and effectively adopt cloud-native services without the need for long planning cycles or a high price tag.
                <br />
                <br />
                The Kubernetes Launchpad includes:
