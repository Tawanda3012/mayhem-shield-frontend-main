                As businesses seek to maximize the value of technology, the limitations of legacy applications and monolithic architectures may become more apparent. These systems can be expensive to maintain, difficult to scale, and frequently lack the security measures required to protect against modern threats. Modernizing these software assets is critical for reaping the benefits of the cloud. However, with so many different applications and stakeholders to consider, it can be difficult to know where to start with a cloud migration.
                <br />
                <br />
                We understand the challenges of modernizing software assets at Mayhem Shield and have developed a comprehensive approach to assisting organizations in successfully migrating to the cloud. Our Application Strategy Workshop is an excellent place to start for any company looking to modernize its software assets. The four-week engagement is a collaborative process led by a Cloud Software Architect who collaborates with a team of experts to understand your organization's unique requirements and identify areas for improvement.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our team conducts a series of onsite and remote sessions throughout the workshop to uncover business and technical challenges, gather input from application owners, users, and other stakeholders, and identify the necessary steps to modernize your software assets. A SkunkWorks project is also included to inspire radical innovation and thinking outside the box.
                <br />
                <br />
                We deliver a comprehensive report at the end of the workshop that includes modernization recommendations, a detailed business case, and an executive briefing. This gives your organization a workable roadmap and backlog, as well as the tools it needs to gain new efficiencies and competitive advantages.
                <br />
